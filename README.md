## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my digital forge! I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a strong interest in software development and IT. Motivated by a passion for technology and problem-solving, I have experience in academic and self-driven projects. I'm actively exploring opportunities to begin a career in the software industry, with a focus on continuous learning and practical impact.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
* AI & ML Projects (including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, CNN, Object Classification, Object Detection) 
* Full-stack Web Development (with React.js, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, RestAPIs, Flask, FastAPI) 
* DevOps and Cloud Computing 
* Embedded Systems & VLSI 
* Automation Tools (like Git & GitHub) 
* Data & Visualization Tools (like Power BI)
## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* DevOps principles
* Advanced Git and CI/CD concepts
* Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) for ECE applications and core concepts from my syllabus (VLSI, Control Systems)

## 💻 Internships & Projects:
✈️ Flight Motion Data Visualizer – At Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), I built an ML system to analyze and visualize flight debrief data for performance review and anomaly detection. I used supervised learning to process flight parameters, enhancing post-flight analysis, and worked with aerospace engineers to integrate results into existing workflows. 

🧠 Automated Vehicle Detection and Counting Systems – Designed and implemented a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using YOLO and OpenCV, optimized for diverse Indian vehicle types. I integrated traffic density prediction to forecast congestion patterns. 

🌿 NutriVision: Smart Food Recognition & Health Report – Focuses on identifying food items and generating health-related reports from that recognition. 

🧪ATM Simulation Web App – As a Full Stack Developer at CGV Technical and Training Services Pvt Ltd, I developed a full-stack ATM simulation web app with features like login, balance check, and transaction history using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. 

💞️CareerLens AI – Built an AI-powered career guidance platform that analyzes resumes to provide personalized feedback, suggests jobs based on user skills, and supports real-time career queries through a chatbot. 

⚙️Remote Drone Control via Web-Based User Interface – Developed a real-time drone control system with a responsive web interface for remote operation and live telemetry monitoring over Wi-Fi/internet, designed for surveillance and inspection.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
* Innovative AI projects
* Offline-first dashboards for institutions and industries
* Full-stack development projects
* Projects involving data visualization and analysis

## 💬 Ask me about:
* Python, C++, Typescript, React.js, Node.js
* Machine Learning, Deep Learning, CNN, Image Processing, Object Detection
* Full Stack Development, REST APIs, MySQL, MongoDB, Flask, FastAPI
* DevOps, Git & GitHub, Cloud Computing, Linux
* My internship experiences at HAL and CGV Technical
* My projects like CareerLens AI, Automated Vehicle Detection and Counting Systems, or Remote Drone Control

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I believe the best way to understand a system is often by trying to 'break' it (ethically, of course!) 💥.
